section Polynomial

/-- A type analogous to `Polynomial` that supports computable operations. This polynomial is
  represented internally as an Array of coefficients.

For example the Array `#[1,2,3]` represents the polynomial `1 + 2x + 3x^2`. Two arrays may represent
the same polynomial via zero-padding, for example `#[1,2,3] = #[1,2,3,0,0,0,...]`.
